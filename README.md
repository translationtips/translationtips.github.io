## 🌟 Why this collection?

- I'm focused on empowering fellow translators and localization professionals with **real-world strategies**—from AI‑tool prompts to file‑format finesse.
- While I occasionally draw inspiration from tools (especially their cloud‑translation blog and resource content), I distill and adapt those insights to suit your day‑to‑day workflow.

## 🔧 Pro Tips & Strategies

- **Craft precise AI prompts**  
  Frame systems like ChatGPT with a clear role (e.g. “Translate as an energy‑sector specialist”) to preserve domain‑specific terminology and tone :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

- **Optimize source for MT quality**  
  Short sentences, minimal jargon, and limited slang = cleaner machine output and faster post‑editing :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Build and leverage translation memories**  
  Ever‑greener TM files speed up recurring translations and improve consistency across projects :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **Use terminology glossaries actively**  
  Maintaining a termbase reduces ambiguity, especially during multi‑file or multilingual assignments :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

- **Plan for text‑expansion in layout**  
  Especially for UI, subtitles, or documentation—expect +20–30 % length in translations like German or Spanish, and design accordingly :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

- **Batch your file processing**  
  Uploading docs in bulk not only saves time—it helps MT engines learn faster across related content :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
